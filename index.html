            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to My World of Coffee and Curiosity!</p>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Christl Tiu, a medical doctor with a penchant for exploring the delightful intersections of healthcare and technology. My journey has taken me from the hands-on world of physical therapy to the frontlines of general practice, and now, I'm setting my sights on the fascinating field of pathology—application coming this September!</p>
            <p>Fueled by copious amounts of coffee and a passion for perpetual learning (thanks, Tim Ferriss!), I'm diving into the world of data analysis with R. Sure, I'm not always up to speed with the latest IT trends, but my enthusiasm and hard-working nature keep me constantly exploring new territories.</p>
            <p>So, grab a cup of coffee, kick back, and join me on this exciting journey. We can explore the quirky intersections of medicine, tech, and everything in between. Let's learn, laugh, and maybe get a little nerdy together!</p>

            <h2>Now</h2>
            <p>At the moment, I’m moonlighting as a general practitioner, taking on various roles but primarily working as a Dialysis Physician on Duty. This work brings me a lot of satisfaction and has become a significant part of my professional life.</p>
            <p>Beyond my medical practice, I'm exploring the expansive world of health IT. Although I can’t disclose specifics, I’m learning a lot about how technology can extend the reach of healthcare and create impactful changes.</p>
            <p>I’m also on a personal quest to master R, using "Yarrr" as my guide. This self-learning journey is about equipping myself to run my own data and make informed decisions based on it.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, you’ll often find me with a book in hand, exploring new ideas and stories. To keep things interesting, I’m dabbling in Krav Maga, adding a bit of physical challenge and self-defense skills to my routine.</p>
